# Remotely-Operable-Missile-Launcher
In the modern era, the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various 
fields, including defense and security systems. The integration of IoT 
technology into missile launchers presents a significant advancement in 
remote-controlled and automated defense mechanisms. This project explores 
the development and implementation of an IoT-based missile launcher, which 
can be controlled worldwide through a secure web interface, utilizing Firebase 
for real-time communication. 
The primary objective of this project is to create a prototype of a missile 
launcher that can be remotely operated via the internet. This involves the use 
of various hardware components, including a NodeMCU for connectivity, boost 
modules for power regulation, relay modules for switching, and servos for 
movement control. The control panel for the launcher is implemented as a 
web application, providing a user-friendly interface for operating the launcher 
from any location with internet access. 
Firebase is used as the central communication platform, offering real-time data 
synchronization and reliable messaging between the web application and the 
missile launcher hardware. This ensures immediate response and control, 
which is crucial for the effective operation of the system.
